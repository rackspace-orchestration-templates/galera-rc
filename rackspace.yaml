  Galera is a multi-master cluster, with synchronous replication, based on MariaDB.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to MySQL or Galera, the [MySQL Manual](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/index.html)
  documentation will step you through the basics of configuration, connecting,
  user, and permission management, and the [Galera Manual](http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/).

  By default, the "root" MySQL user can only connect from localhost (127.0.0.1).
  You will need to connect to the server and use the MySQL client in order to
  allow "root" to connect from external servers.

  As a part of your server configuration, your server will be configured to run
  nightly backups leveraging
  [Holland](https://github.com/holland-backup/holland#readme).  Backups will be
  stored in the directory /var/lib/mysqlbackups directory on the master node.
  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  #### Additional Notes
  All write operations should be performed on the Master node. Read operations
  can be performed against any servers in this deployment. By default, all new
  and existing databases will be replicated across the members of this
  deployment.
  All write or read operations can be performed against any nodes in the
  cluster.  Additionally, you can add or remove nodes at will by adjusting the
  "server_count" parameter.  Please note that, after adding a new node to the
  cluster, it can take some time for the data to be synchronized to the new
  node.
